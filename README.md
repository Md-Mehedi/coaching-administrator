## Description
#### Motivation

<div style='text-align: justify'>
As the world of internet progress, the need of online management  of an organization also increases day by day. In order to cope with the situation, we introduce our project idea called <b>Coaching Administrator</b> to manage coaching centers or personal tuitions. Why we chose to build such a web app, the reasons are given below shortly.
</div>

- Too much dependency on social media causes distraction from studies
- Many organizations cannot afford  a single website 
- Personal tutors fail to manage tuition efficiently 
- Provide low cost services

#### Architecture
